# Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>
I have picked sparkify as my final project for data science nano-degree capstone where we will be predicting the customer’s churn. Sparkify is a digital music service platform where we have free and paid users streaming the music online. In a simple term, we will be using various machine learning algorithm using spark MLlib to predict the customers who are most likely to cancel their subscription in future.

# Solutions Steps <a name="solution"></a>

1. Loading and Cleaning the data
2. Exploratory data analysis
    Defining Churn
    Exploring the data
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modelling — Test out several of the machine learning algorithm

# Files <a name="files"></a>

The Repository contains this README.md and a Sparkify.ipynb file. The Jupyter Notebook called Sparkify.ipynb have all the solution steps mentioned above.

# Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/latyanvikas/sparkify_capstone.git
```

# Results <a name="results"></a>

As an objective of this project, we have successfully used spark to load the data, clean the data, performing EDA and feature engineering the data for implementing machine learning algorithms. We have designed a scalable solution and made use of module so that this solution can be implemented on full size data.

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://vikaslatyan.medium.com/sparkify-churn-model-3a1046bcebec).
